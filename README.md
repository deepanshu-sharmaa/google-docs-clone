# Google Docs Clone

A basic clone of the frontend of Google Docs using React js and Quill text editor.

## Components

There are three components in the clone:

1.) Navbar: This component is the navbar of the Google Docs that has Google Docs logo, name of the document, share button and other options like File, Edit, View, etc. The user can change the name of the document.

2.) Editor: This is the main component of the Google Docs, which I made using Quill, an API driven text editor, which replicates features like Bold, Italics, font size, font styles of the original Google Docs in the toolbar section. The user can type the document in the editor.

3.) Sidebar: This is the component placed at the right side of the screen. It has the profile photo of the user on the top and has links to major Google's tools like Calendar, Keep Notes, Tasks, Contacts, and Maps.
